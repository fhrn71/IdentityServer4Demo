# IdentityServer4Demo

This solution is a modified and upgraded version of the demo used in the PluralSight course:<br/>
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dotnet-core-oauth2-openid-connect-securing<br/>

The solution covers the different aspects of securing an ASP.Net Core application using OAuth2 with OpenID Connect:
- Defining your test server with IdentityResources, ApiResources, Clients and Users
- Wiring up the client app to use the claim based Authentication
- Securing Client
- Passing Access Token to API
- Securing API
The solution is made in VS2017 with .Net Core 2 and IdentityServer4.
The initial version supports role based authorisation.
